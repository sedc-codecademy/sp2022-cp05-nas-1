            "content": "<p>President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the gun safety package passed by Congress this week.</p> <p>\"Time is of the essence,\" Biden said as he delivered remarks in the Roosevelt Room alongside first lady Jill Biden. \"Lives will be saved.\"</p> <p>The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act broke a nearly 30-year stalemate on Capitol Hill, becoming the first major piece of federal gun reform to clear both chambers since the Brady bill.</p> <p>\"At a time when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,\" Biden said.</p> <p>A bipartisan group of senators began crafting the legislation in the aftermath of a tragic mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 young children and two teachers dead.</p> <p>In heartbreaking testimony, lawmakers heard directly from a fourth grader trapped inside her classroom as the rampage unfolded. She testified that she smeared herself with her classmate's blood and played dead to survive as the shooter terrorized the school for more than an hour.</p> <p>The House passed the Senate-backed legislation on Friday -- exactly one month after the Uvalde massacre.</p> <p>Following the historic vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a bill enrollment ceremony where she said Congress was \"honoring a promise in honor of all those who have lost loved ones to gun violence.\"</p> <p>The law includes $750 million to help states implement \"red flag\" laws to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, as well as other violence prevention programs. It also provides funding for a variety of programs aimed at shoring up the nation's mental health apparatus and securing schools.</p> <p>It will enhance background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21 by giving authorities up to 10 business days to review the juvenile and mental health records of young gun purchasers, and makes it unlawful for someone to purchase a gun for someone who would fail a background check.</p> <p>Another key provision is closing the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" so individuals in \"serious\" \"dating relationships\" who are convicted of domestic abuse will be prevented from purchasing a gun.</p> <p>But the law doesn't go as far as Democrats -- and Biden -- wanted, excluding measures such as universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.</p> <p>The House has passed several bills with stricter gun regulations, but none have been taken up in the Senate.</p> <p>\"I know there's much more work to do, and I'm never going to give up,\" Biden said on Saturday. \"But this is a monumental day.\"</p> <p>The signing of the gun safety bill comes just days after a major Supreme Court decision expanding gun rights.</p> <p>The court's conservative majority struck down a 100-year-old New York law that restricted the concealed carry of handguns in public to only those with a \"proper cause.\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the opinion that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual's right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.</p> <p>The high court on Friday also delivered a ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision legalizing abortion access nationwide for the past 50 years.</p> <p>When asked about the Supreme Court on Saturday, Biden said he thought the court has \"made some terrible decisions.\"</p>",

            "content": "<p>A tiny satellite is poised to set the stage for something far grander: a full-blown lunar space station. NASA's CAPSTONE satellite is scheduled to launch on Monday and then travel to a unique lunar orbit in a pathfinder mission for the Artemis program, which is seeking to return humans to the Moon later this decade.</p> <p>CAPSTONE is hitching a ride on board Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, which will take off from the private company's Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand. Rocket Lab made headlines in May by using a helicopter to catch a falling booster rocket. The CAPSTONE launch is scheduled for 6 a.m. ET on June 27 with live coverage starting an hour earlier. You can catch the action at the agency's website or app.</p> <p>Approximately one week into the CAPSTONE mission, the probe's journey will be made available through NASA's Eyes on the Solar System interactive real-time 3D data visualization.</p> <p>The Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) mission will send a microwave-sized satellite to a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the Moon. The satellite will be the first to cruise its way around this unique lunar orbit, testing it out for the planned Lunar Gateway, a small space station that is meant to allow for a sustained human presence on the Moon.</p> <p>NRHO is special in that it's where the pull of gravity from the Moon and Earth interact; this orbit will theoretically keep spacecraft in a “gravitational sweet spot” in a near-stable orbit around the Moon, according to NASA. NRHO is therefore ideal in that it will require less fuel than conventional orbits and it will allow the proposed lunar space station to maintain a constant line of communication with Earth. But before NASA builds out its Gateway in this highly elliptical orbit, the space agency will use CAPSTONE—owned and operated by Colorado-based Advanced Space—to test its orbital models.</p> <p>Six days after launching from Earth, the Electron rocket’s upper stage will release the CAPSTONE satellite on its journey to the Moon. The 55-pound (25-kilogram) cubesat will then perform the rest of its four-month trip solo. Once at the Moon, CAPSTONE will test the orbital dynamics of its orbit for about six months. The satellite will also be used to test spacecraft-to-spacecraft navigation technology and one-way ranging capabilities that could eventually reduce the need for future spacecraft to communicate with mission controllers on Earth and wait to have signals relayed from other spacecraft.</p> </p> <p>NASA is methodically putting together the pieces for the agency's planned return to the Moon. The fourth and most recent wet dress rehearsal of the space agency's Space Launch System (SLS) went well, paving the way for a possible launch in late August.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Samsung is getting ready to release its massive 55-inch curved Odyssey Ark monitor in August, according to a report from Korean outlet ETNews (via SamMobile). The monitor, which was announced in January at CES, has reportedly gone through a few certification programs that have to be done before it can go on sale.</p> <p>Details about this monitor are still scant. The company has said that it’ll have a 16:9 4K panel and that the stand will support pivot, tilt, and rotation. It also announced that it would come out in the second half of 2022 (which the reported August window falls squarely in). But let's be honest, when you show up with a monitor that promises to physically tower over you while you're using it, people will pay attention even if you don't announce the price or refresh rate.</p> <p>Many of us here at The Verge are very excited for this monitor — when it came time to hand out awards for CES 2022, we gave it Best in Show. But as with many CES announcements, as the months wear on, it can be hard to remember anything from the flood of gadgets and tech; did Samsung really announce an extremely curved, extremely large monitor that can stretch over and around you, or was that just a fever dream? Rumors that it could actually be coming out relatively soon prove that it was, in fact, actually announced and reminds us that we are looking forward to it.</p> <p>One thing that adds a bit of credence to the report is that Samsung has successfully released other monitors that it announced around CES this year. The decidedly less ambitious (but very cute) M8 monitor has already started hitting store shelves, as has a smaller (read: reasonably sized) curved gaming monitor, the Odyssey Neo G8. While that's obviously not proof that the Ark is up next, it is good to see that Samsung has a track record of shipping its CES monitors this year.</p>",

            "content": "<p>\"Thor: Love and Thunder\" marks Natalie Portman's first major Marvel Cinematic Universe appearance since 2013's \"Thor 2.\" While the \"Black Swan\" star is reprising her role as Jane Foster from the first two \"Thor\" films, her third appearance will look dramatically different from anything Marvel fans have seen her do before. Rather than sitting on the sidelines as a love interest for the God of Thunder, Taika Waititis new film sees her picking up the hammer and suiting up as a superhero in her own right.</p> <p>But to do that, she had to get in superhero shape. Portman spent 10 months working out for the film, including several months of conditioning before she began actively adding muscle. And once the shoot started, she was training at 4:30 a.m. every day. The process was overseen by trainer Naomi Pendergast, who outlined Portman's workout regimen in a new interview with Variety.</p> <p>\"The goal and initial brief for working with Natalie was to develop arm and abdominal definition,\" Pendergast said. \"However, to safely get Natalie to this goal without injury we worked to condition her body first for about four months. This meant we could safely up the load to bulk her up without negatively affecting her joints.\"</p> <p>Once Portman was fit enough to start bulking up without risking injuries, they were off to the races. Because they were training during the COVID pandemic, much of the initial work was done with dumbbells. And lots and lots of boxing.</p> <p>\"We worked on building her upper body three times a week, which included arm, back, chest exercises, boxing, skipping and running,\" she said. \"The other two days were dedicated to injury prevention work, which included Pilates-based exercises, stretching, release work and balance exercises.\"</p> <p>Of course, working out is useless without the right diet, and Pendergast also had to work to ensure that Portman could add muscle while sticking to her vegan diet.</p> <p>\"Natalie is an extremely healthy person with a very wholesome and clean diet, so we did not have to make any major changes to her food,\" she said. \"Natalie is a vegan, so for her to get enough protein to bulk up the way she needed we had to increase her daily amount by adding vegan-based protein powders a couple of times a day.\"",

Sturm, Ruger & Co.’s stock is only down roughly 8% this year, outperforming the rest of the market amid the ongoing selloff in 2022. Shares of Smith & Wesson, Ammo Inc. and Vista Outdoor have all fallen by 20% or more, however. </p> <p>In the case of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v.

            "description": "Manchester United are adamant that Cristiano Ronaldo is not for sale and will still be at Old Trafford next season, despite the Portugal striker being linked with a stunning move to Premier League rivals Chelsea.",
            "content": "<p> Ronaldo enjoyed an impressive return to United last season - at least on an individual basis - scoring 24 goals in 38 appearances and being voted for the PFA Player of the Year award.</p> <p>The 37-year-old signed a three-year contract when he re-joined Manchester United last summer but he was linked with a move away from Old Trafford throughout the 2021-21 campaign and that speculation has only increased since the end of the season.</p> <p>Ronaldo, desperate to win trophies at United and get back into the Champions League, is said to be concerned by the club’s transfer strategy, with several deals stalling in the early stages of the transfer window.</p> <p>On Saturday, it was reported that new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly had met Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes in Portugal, where the player's future at United and a possible move to Stamford Bridge was discussed.</p> <p>While Chelsea’s interest in Ronaldo is unknown, Thomas Tuchel is desperate to bolster his attacking options this summer after sanctioning the departure of £97.5m flop Romelu Lukaku, who is set to return to Inter Milan on a season-long loan.</p> <p>The Blues have also been linked with Raheem Sterling and Robert Lewandowski and it appears that Chelsea will be left disappointed if they do make a move for Ronaldo as United are adamant he is staying put.</p> <p>A senior club source told the Manchester Evening News: \"Cristiano is not for sale. We want and fully expect him to be with us next season.\"</p> <p>Ronaldo, who has won five Ballon d’Or awards, insisted last month that he was \"happy\" at Manchester United and excited to work under new boss Erik ten Hag.</p> <p>Ten Hag is taking over a team who finished just sixth in the Premier League last season despite Ronaldo's goals.</p> <p>\"I was and still am very happy to be here, and what I have to say to the fans is they are amazing\", Ronaldo said.</p> <p>Even when we lost games, they always support us, they always are with us. The supporters are always in my heart and it's the people that we all should respect because they are always on our side.</p> <p>For me, the most important thing is to try to win the games and try to win some championship or some cup but I believe that Manchester will be where they belong. As I say before, sometimes it takes time but I still believe. </p> <p>What I know about him [Ten Hag] is he did a fantastic job for Ajax, that he's an experienced coach. But we need to give him time.</p> <p>Things need to change the way he wants. I hope we have success, of course, because, if you have success, all of Manchester is going to have success as well. I wish him the best.</p> <p>\"We are happy and excited, not only as players, but the supporters as well. I wish him the best and let's believe that, next year, we are going to win trophies.\"</p>",
