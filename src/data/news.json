            "description": " NASA is launching a study of UFOs as part of a new push toward high-risk, high-impact science.",
            "content": "The space agency announced Thursday that it’s setting up an independent team to see how much information is publicly available on the matter and how much more is needed to understand the unexplained sightings. The experts will also consider how best to use all this information in the future. \n \n NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen acknowledged the traditional scientific community may see NASA as \"kind of selling out\" by venturing into the controversial topic, but he strongly disagrees. \n \n “We are not shying away from reputational risk,” Zurbuchen said during a National Academy of Sciences webcast. \"Our strong belief is that the biggest challenge of these phenomena is that it's a data-poor field.\" \n \n NASA considers this a first step in trying to explain mysterious sightings in the sky known as UAPs, or unidentified aerial phenomena. \n \n The study will begin this fall and last nine months, costing no more than $100,000. It will be entirely open, with no classified military data used.  \n \n  NASA said the team will be led by astrophysicist David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation for advancing scientific research. In a news conference, Spergel said the only preconceived notion going into the study is that the UAPs will likely have multiple explanations. \n \n  “We have to approach all these questions with a sense of humility,\" Spergel said. “I spent most of my career as a cosmologist. I can tell you we don't know what makes up 95% of the universe. So there are things we don't understand.\" \n \n",

            "description": "New research led by University of South Australia scientists supports a causal effect of vitamin D deficiency on brain health, notably for the risk of dementia, but not on stroke risk.",
            "content": "\"Vitamin D is a hormone precursor that is increasingly recognized for widespread effects, including on brain health,\" said senior author Professor Elina Hyppönen, a researcher with the Australian Centre for Precision Health at the University of South Australia and the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, and her colleagues. \n \n \"Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D — an indicator of vitamin D status — concentrations are common, and the prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency ranges from 5% to 50%, depending on location and population characteristics.\"   \"There are various mechanisms by which active vitamin D may affect the brain, including the regulation of neurotrophic growth factors, influences on inflammation, and thrombosis.\" \n \n \"With a growing interest in identifying modifiable risk factors for dementia and stroke, vitamin D has become an attractive candidate, as supplementation, diet, and sunlight exposure can maintain adequate serum concentrations.\"  \n \n  In a large-scale prospective study, the authors used information from 33,523 participants of the UK Biobank to examine the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with a range of brain neuroimaging features. \n \n  Extending the analyses to 427,690 participants, they also examined the associations with the risks of dementia and stroke using the nonlinear Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach. \n \n Vitamin D deficiency was associated with an increased risk of dementia and stroke, with the strongest associations for those with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 25 nmol/L.  \n \n  Nonlinear MR analyses confirmed the threshold effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on dementia, with the risk predicted to be 54% higher for participants at 25 nmol/L compared with 50 nmol/L. \n \n However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not associated with neuroimaging outcomes or the risk of stroke in the MR analyses.  \n \n \"Our findings are important for the prevention of dementia and appreciating the need to abolish vitamin D deficiency,\" Professor Hyppönen said.  \n \n \"Indeed, in this UK population we observed that up to 17% of dementia cases might have been avoided by boosting vitamin D levels to be within a normal range (50 nmol/L).\"  \n \n \"Larger MR studies are needed to confirm causality for the proposed associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and brain morphometry,\" the researchers said.  \n \n \"Our MR results suggest no clear association with stroke, whereas a causal relation with dementia risk provides an important opportunity for prevention.\"  \n \n",

            "description": "The share prices of U.S. gun- and ammunition makers shot up Thursday after the Supreme Court struck down a New York law restricting concealed carry, the widest expansion of gun rights in over a decade that could lead to further rollbacks across the nation.",
            "content": "In a 6-3 ruling on Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a New York State law restricting firearm owners from having a concealed carry weapon permit unless they had \"proper cause\" to do so and demonstrated \"good moral character.\" \n \nIn a major blow for gun control advocates, Supreme Court justices ruled that New York's concealed carry law violated the Fourteenth Amendment by stopping \"law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs\" from practicing their Second Amendment right to bear arms. \n \n The share prices of major gun- and ammunition makers surged higher following the Supreme Court decision: The largest public U.S. gunmaker ($1.1 billion market value), Sturm, Ruger & Co., saw its stock rise nearly 3% \n \n Shares of Smith & Wesson Brands, the second-largest gunmaker ($600 million market value), jumped over 6%, and major ammunition makers such as Vista Outdoor and Ammo Inc. also shot higher, both rising by around 3% or more. \n \n Other gun- and ammo-related stocks also rallied on Thursday: Big 5 Sporting Goods jumped nearly 5% and American Outdoor Brands rose roughly 6%, while weapons producer Axon Enterprises gained over 3%. \n \n Shares of gun and ammunition companies typically tend to rise after mass shootings or amid political discussions around stricter gun laws, as Americans tend to stock up ahead in anticipation of tighter restrictions. Amid a high number of mass shootings—roughly 250—so far in 2022, there has been renewed debate on gun control legislation in Congress and elsewhere. Sturm, Ruger & Co.’s stock is only down roughly 8% this year, outperforming the rest of the market amid the ongoing selloff in 2022. Shares of Smith & Wesson, Ammo Inc. and Vista Outdoor have all fallen by 20% or more, however.  \n \n In the case of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Second Amendment's definition of the right to \"bear arms\" includes \"carrying handguns publicly for self-defense.\" Other constitutional rights don't \"require individuals to demonstrate to government officers some special need,\" the justices added. \n \n  Whether the Supreme Court decision on New York’s concealed carry law will set a precedent that could overturn similar laws in other Democratic states. At least eight other states and the District of Columbia all have similar regulations where authorities have some discretion when it comes to issuing concealed carry permits to citizens. \n \n",

            "description": "The union representing United Airlines pilots has approved a tentative deal that would give the aviators pay raises of more than 14%, making it the first major U.S. carrier to reach a deal since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and setting the bar for the rest of the industry.",
            "content": "The agreement comes as the airline and others grapple with a shortage of pilots, which some carriers say have forced them to trim flight schedules. The contract faces a vote by rank-and-file pilots that will conclude in mid-July. \n \n Under the agreement approved Friday, pilots would get more than 14.5% in pay increases within 18 months, according to the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents about 14,000 United pilots.  \n \n  Pilot pay at United as of 2020 ranged from about $73,000 a year for an early-career first officer on the carrier’s smallest aircraft to more than $337,000 for a wide-body captain, according to Kit Darby, a pilot pay consultant and retired United captain. However, pay can vary widely depending on how often pilots fly. \n \n The two-year agreement also includes eight weeks of paid maternity leave, a first for the carrier’s pilots. United said women comprise about 7% of its pilot ranks.  \n \n  The agreement sets the tone for negotiations with other large U.S. carriers, including Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, as unions seek quality-of-life improvements after two years of the pandemic. Some pilots say airlines have created grueling schedules to capitalize on a rebound in travel that has left them fatigued, and some have recently picketed to protest conditions. \n \n In a video message to pilots last week, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said the company would consider other carriers’ agreements, including United’s, and update its pay proposals once the details are known.  \n \n  \"Our team will be paid well and be paid competitively. You are not going to fall behind network peers,\" Isom said in the video seen by CNBC. \n \n Flight attendants and other work groups at major carriers are also in contract talks.  \n \n  Airlines' staffing struggles grew worse in the pandemic. Although U.S. airlines received $54 billion in taxpayer payroll aid that prohibited layoffs, airlines urged many pilots to take early retirement and leaves of absence, which created a hiring and training backlog. \n \n The shortage of pilots is particularly acute at regional carriers, which often fly to smaller cities. Two of American Airlines’ regional carriers Envoy and Piedmont last week said they would temporarily increase pilot pay by more than 50% to help attract and retain staff as competition for aviators heats up across the industry.  \n \n",

            "content": "Samsung is getting ready to release its massive 55-inch curved Odyssey Ark monitor in August, according to a report from Korean outlet ETNews (via SamMobile). The monitor, which was announced in January at CES, has reportedly gone through a few certification programs that have to be done before it can go on sale. \n \n Details about this monitor are still scant. The company has said that it’ll have a 16:9 4K panel and that the stand will support pivot, tilt, and rotation. It also announced that it would come out in the second half of 2022 (which the reported August window falls squarely in). But let's be honest, when you show up with a monitor that promises to physically tower over you while you're using it, people will pay attention even if you don't announce the price or refresh rate. \n \n Many of us here at The Verge are very excited for this monitor — when it came time to hand out awards for CES 2022, we gave it Best in Show. But as with many CES announcements, as the months wear on, it can be hard to remember anything from the flood of gadgets and tech; did Samsung really announce an extremely curved, extremely large monitor that can stretch over and around you, or was that just a fever dream? Rumors that it could actually be coming out relatively soon prove that it was, in fact, actually announced and reminds us that we are looking forward to it. \n \n One thing that adds a bit of credence to the report is that Samsung has successfully released other monitors that it announced around CES this year. The decidedly less ambitious (but very cute) M8 monitor has already started hitting store shelves, as has a smaller (read: reasonably sized) curved gaming monitor, the Odyssey Neo G8. While that's obviously not proof that the Ark is up next, it is good to see that Samsung has a track record of shipping its CES monitors this year. \n \n",

The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. \n \n Toyota is viewed as a relative latecomer to the electric vehicle market, as compared to rival manufacturers like Tesla, which launched its first electric car 14 years ago. \n \nIt launched the bZ4X in Japan last month. The car was only available on lease \"to eliminate customer concerns regarding residual battery performance, maintenance and residual value,\" Toyota said earlier this year. \n \n This week, the company said it would cut the number of vehicles it plans to produce next month by 50,000 to 800,000 because of a shortage of computer chips and supply disruptions caused by the pandemic. \n \n Although Toyota currently aims to manufacture a total of 9.7m vehicles around the world this year, it has signalled that it may be forced to lower that number.",

Or are the clouds forming at different altitudes, where the pressure and temperature affect the crystalline structure, resulting a different color?' \n \n Jupiter is located more than 467 million miles from Earth and its atmosphere is composed of hydrogen and helium. \n \n Scientists hope to better understand these areas by creating a catalog of the vortices and 'match them with the underlying physics/chemistry of the location that they form in,' Sankar wrote in a <a href='https://cse.umn.edu/physics/news/school-leads-citizen-science-effort-study-jupiters-atmosphere'>blog post</a>. \n \n 'If one person is having trouble categorizing an image, maybe others will, too,' Sankar said.

            "description": "The Oscar winner went through some seriously intense workouts to get herself back in Marvel shape.",
            "content": "\"Thor: Love and Thunder\" marks Natalie Portman's first major Marvel Cinematic Universe appearance since 2013's \"Thor 2.\" While the \"Black Swan\" star is reprising her role as Jane Foster from the first two \"Thor\" films, her third appearance will look dramatically different from anything Marvel fans have seen her do before. Rather than sitting on the sidelines as a love interest for the God of Thunder, Taika Waititis new film sees her picking up the hammer and suiting up as a superhero in her own right. \n \n But to do that, she had to get in superhero shape. Portman spent 10 months working out for the film, including several months of conditioning before she began actively adding muscle. And once the shoot started, she was training at 4:30 a.m. every day. The process was overseen by trainer Naomi Pendergast, who outlined Portman's workout regimen in a new interview with Variety. \n \n \"The goal and initial brief for working with Natalie was to develop arm and abdominal definition,\" Pendergast said. \"However, to safely get Natalie to this goal without injury we worked to condition her body first for about four months. This meant we could safely up the load to bulk her up without negatively affecting her joints.\" \n \n Once Portman was fit enough to start bulking up without risking injuries, they were off to the races. Because they were training during the COVID pandemic, much of the initial work was done with dumbbells. And lots and lots of boxing. \n \n \"We worked on building her upper body three times a week, which included arm, back, chest exercises, boxing, skipping and running,\" she said. \"The other two days were dedicated to injury prevention work, which included Pilates-based exercises, stretching, release work and balance exercises.\" \n \n Of course, working out is useless without the right diet, and Pendergast also had to work to ensure that Portman could add muscle while sticking to her vegan diet. \n \n \"Natalie is an extremely healthy person with a very wholesome and clean diet, so we did not have to make any major changes to her food,\" she said. \"Natalie is a vegan, so for her to get enough protein to bulk up the way she needed we had to increase her daily amount by adding vegan-based protein powders a couple of times a day.\"",

            "description": "President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the gun safety package passed by Congress this week.",
            "content": "President Joe Biden on Saturday signed into law the gun safety package passed by Congress this week. \n \n \"Time is of the essence,\" Biden said as he delivered remarks in the Roosevelt Room alongside first lady Jill Biden. \"Lives will be saved.\" \n \n The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act broke a nearly 30-year stalemate on Capitol Hill, becoming the first major piece of federal gun reform to clear both chambers since the Brady bill. \n \n \"At a time when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,\" Biden said. \n \n A bipartisan group of senators began crafting the legislation in the aftermath of a tragic mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 young children and two teachers dead. \n \n In heartbreaking testimony, lawmakers heard directly from a fourth grader trapped inside her classroom as the rampage unfolded. She testified that she smeared herself with her classmate's blood and played dead to survive as the shooter terrorized the school for more than an hour. \n \n The House passed the Senate-backed legislation on Friday -- exactly one month after the Uvalde massacre. \n \n Following the historic vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a bill enrollment ceremony where she said Congress was \"honoring a promise in honor of all those who have lost loved ones to gun violence.\" \n \n The law includes $750 million to help states implement \"red flag\" laws to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, as well as other violence prevention programs. It also provides funding for a variety of programs aimed at shoring up the nation's mental health apparatus and securing schools. \n \n It will enhance background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21 by giving authorities up to 10 business days to review the juvenile and mental health records of young gun purchasers, and makes it unlawful for someone to purchase a gun for someone who would fail a background check. \n \n Another key provision is closing the so-called \"boyfriend loophole\" so individuals in \"serious\" \"dating relationships\" who are convicted of domestic abuse will be prevented from purchasing a gun. \n \n But the law doesn't go as far as Democrats -- and Biden -- wanted, excluding measures such as universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n \n The House has passed several bills with stricter gun regulations, but none have been taken up in the Senate. \n \n \"I know there's much more work to do, and I'm never going to give up,\" Biden said on Saturday. \"But this is a monumental day.\" \n \n The signing of the gun safety bill comes just days after a major Supreme Court decision expanding gun rights. \n \n The court's conservative majority struck down a 100-year-old New York law that restricted the concealed carry of handguns in public to only those with a \"proper cause.\" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the opinion that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual's right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home. \n \n The high court on Friday also delivered a ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision legalizing abortion access nationwide for the past 50 years. \n \n When asked about the Supreme Court on Saturday, Biden said he thought the court has \"made some terrible decisions.\" \n \n",

            "content": "A tiny satellite is poised to set the stage for something far grander: a full-blown lunar space station. NASA's CAPSTONE satellite is scheduled to launch on Monday and then travel to a unique lunar orbit in a pathfinder mission for the Artemis program, which is seeking to return humans to the Moon later this decade. \n \n CAPSTONE is hitching a ride on board Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, which will take off from the private company's Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand. Rocket Lab made headlines in May by using a helicopter to catch a falling booster rocket. The CAPSTONE launch is scheduled for 6 a.m. ET on June 27 with live coverage starting an hour earlier. You can catch the action at the agency's website or app. \n \n Approximately one week into the CAPSTONE mission, the probe's journey will be made available through NASA's Eyes on the Solar System interactive real-time 3D data visualization. \n \n The Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) mission will send a microwave-sized satellite to a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the Moon. The satellite will be the first to cruise its way around this unique lunar orbit, testing it out for the planned Lunar Gateway, a small space station that is meant to allow for a sustained human presence on the Moon. \n \n NRHO is special in that it's where the pull of gravity from the Moon and Earth interact; this orbit will theoretically keep spacecraft in a “gravitational sweet spot” in a near-stable orbit around the Moon, according to NASA. NRHO is therefore ideal in that it will require less fuel than conventional orbits and it will allow the proposed lunar space station to maintain a constant line of communication with Earth. But before NASA builds out its Gateway in this highly elliptical orbit, the space agency will use CAPSTONE—owned and operated by Colorado-based Advanced Space—to test its orbital models. \n \n Six days after launching from Earth, the Electron rocket’s upper stage will release the CAPSTONE satellite on its journey to the Moon. The 55-pound (25-kilogram) cubesat will then perform the rest of its four-month trip solo. Once at the Moon, CAPSTONE will test the orbital dynamics of its orbit for about six months. The satellite will also be used to test spacecraft-to-spacecraft navigation technology and one-way ranging capabilities that could eventually reduce the need for future spacecraft to communicate with mission controllers on Earth and wait to have signals relayed from other spacecraft. \n \n  \n \n NASA is methodically putting together the pieces for the agency's planned return to the Moon. The fourth and most recent wet dress rehearsal of the space agency's Space Launch System (SLS) went well, paving the way for a possible launch in late August. \n \n",

            "content": "Rafa Nadal returns to Wimbledon for the first time in three years but it will feel a little odd for the Spaniard who, for the first time at the All England Club, will not have sparring partner Roger Federer for company. \n \n Their epic rivalry includes three successive Wimbledon finals from 2006 -- the first two won by Federer and the last by Nadal in unforgettable fashion in 2008. \n \n Federer played in the juniors at Wimbledon in 1998 and has been back every year since, winning a record eight titles and establishing himself as the king of the lawns. \n \n But the 40-year-old will be absent this year as the 36-year-old Nadal seeks to continue his quest for the calendar year Grand Slam, having won the Australian Open and French Open to take his haul of majors to a record 22. \n \n Federer's absence because of a knee injury that has sidelined him for a year will leave Wimbledon a little empty. \n \n Nadal acknowledges that without the Swiss raising the bar, his own achievements might not have been possible. \n \n \"I mean, we shared lot of important things together,\" second seed Nadal told reporters on Saturday. \"It's difficult in some ways to think of tennis in the last 15, 20 years without thinking about the rivalry that we have. \n \n \"I think in some way we push each other. I always wanted to think that my motivation never comes to me because of others, that it's a personal motivation. \n \n \"But, of course, to have somebody like him, like a rival, that he's amazingly good, helps you to let you know the things that you have to do better.\" \n \n Federer has hinted at making a comeback after Wimbledon with an eye on the U.S. Open, which could allow Nadal to complete his collection against the Swiss great. \n \n \"We've been playing in every big stadium, but not in New York, that's the only thing that bothers me a little bit, that we never played in New York,\" Nadal said. \n \n Nadal's appearance at Wimbledon was thrown into doubt over a foot injury that required him to have a numbing injection at the French Open just to get through his matches. \n \n A small surgical procedure since has allowed him to play without terrible pain, but the Spaniard said that he does not know whether the injury will flare up again. \n \n \"I can't tell you if I'm going to be in this positive moment for one week, for two days, or for three months,\" he said. \n \n Of course, the treatment that I did didn't fix my injury, not improving my injury at all, but it can take out a little bit of the pain. That's the main goal. \n \n \"For the last two weeks, I didn't have one terrible day where I can't move at all. Of course, some days are better; some days are a little bit worse.\" \n \n Nadal opens his quest for a third Wimbledon title against Argentine debutant Francisco Cerundolo. \n \n",

            "content": "While the war in Ukraine continues to rage on in the country's eastern region, tensions between the Kremlin and Europe are getting worse.  \n \n Most recently, Moscow's defence ministry said its troops had destroyed \"up to 80 Polish fighters, 20 armoured combat vehicles and eight Grad multiple rocket launchers in precision strikes on the Megatex zinc factory in Konstantinovka\".  \n \n This is in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, which Vladimir Putin is trying to seize full control over.  \n \n In the Russian city of Smolensk, Kremlin officials have removed the Polish flag from the Katyn memorial - erected in memory of 25,000 Poles massacred by the Soviet Union's police in 1940.  \n \n  Most of the victims were army officers thought be to be anti-communist, who were killed on the orders of Joseph Stalin in a forest near the city. \n \n The Soviet Union tried to deny responsibility and blame the Nazis for the mass killing but they eventually admitted the atrocity in 1990.  \n \n  Speaking about the flag's removal, Smolensk's mayor Andrei Borisov said: There cannot be Polish flags on Russian monuments. Even less so after the frankly anti-Russian comments by Polish political leaders. \n \n  The culture ministry of the Russian Federation made the right decision by removing the Polish flag. Katyn is a Russian memorial. \n \n Poland has supported Ukraine since Putin sent his soldiers across the border in February.  \n \n  It has supplied weapons and has taken in the largest number of Ukrainian refugees of any European country - some 1.1 million. \n \n As a Nato member, a military strike on Poland would mean all other members, including Britain, would leap to its defence.  \n \n  The Kremlin has also recently threatened Lithuania for blocking EU-sanctioned goods from reaching the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. \n \n  Kaliningrad has land borders with Lithuania and Poland and is isolated from the rest of Russia. \n \n Goods normally reach the territory by rail via Belarus and Lithuania - there are no transport routes through Poland.  \n \n  Russia is still able to supply Kaliningrad by sea, without falling foul of EU sanctions but has demanded Lithuania lift its ban, warning that if transport links are not restored in full \"Russia reserves the right to take action in defence of its national interests\". \n \n Lithuania is also a Nato member state, so any attack on it would be seen as an attack on the alliance.  \n \n",

            "description": "Manchester United are adamant that Cristiano Ronaldo is not for sale and will still be at Old Trafford next season, despite the Portugal striker being linked with a stunning move to Premier League rivals Chelsea.",
            "content": " Ronaldo enjoyed an impressive return to United last season - at least on an individual basis - scoring 24 goals in 38 appearances and being voted for the PFA Player of the Year award. \n \n The 37-year-old signed a three-year contract when he re-joined Manchester United last summer but he was linked with a move away from Old Trafford throughout the 2021-21 campaign and that speculation has only increased since the end of the season. \n \n Ronaldo, desperate to win trophies at United and get back into the Champions League, is said to be concerned by the club’s transfer strategy, with several deals stalling in the early stages of the transfer window. \n \n On Saturday, it was reported that new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly had met Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes in Portugal, where the player's future at United and a possible move to Stamford Bridge was discussed. \n \n While Chelsea’s interest in Ronaldo is unknown, Thomas Tuchel is desperate to bolster his attacking options this summer after sanctioning the departure of £97.5m flop Romelu Lukaku, who is set to return to Inter Milan on a season-long loan. \n \n The Blues have also been linked with Raheem Sterling and Robert Lewandowski and it appears that Chelsea will be left disappointed if they do make a move for Ronaldo as United are adamant he is staying put. \n \n A senior club source told the Manchester Evening News: \"Cristiano is not for sale. We want and fully expect him to be with us next season.\" \n \n Ronaldo, who has won five Ballon d’Or awards, insisted last month that he was \"happy\" at Manchester United and excited to work under new boss Erik ten Hag. \n \n Ten Hag is taking over a team who finished just sixth in the Premier League last season despite Ronaldo's goals. \n \n \"I was and still am very happy to be here, and what I have to say to the fans is they are amazing\", Ronaldo said. \n \n Even when we lost games, they always support us, they always are with us. The supporters are always in my heart and it's the people that we all should respect because they are always on our side. \n \n For me, the most important thing is to try to win the games and try to win some championship or some cup but I believe that Manchester will be where they belong. As I say before, sometimes it takes time but I still believe.  \n \n What I know about him [Ten Hag] is he did a fantastic job for Ajax, that he's an experienced coach. But we need to give him time. \n \n Things need to change the way he wants. I hope we have success, of course, because, if you have success, all of Manchester is going to have success as well. I wish him the best. \n \n \"We are happy and excited, not only as players, but the supporters as well. I wish him the best and let's believe that, next year, we are going to win trophies.\" \n \n",

            "content": " Wales captain Gareth Bale confirmed his move to Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC on Saturday following his departure from Spanish giants Real Madrid. Bale confirmed his plans to join LAFC in a post on Twitter following widespread reports earlier Saturday about the move. \"See you soon, Los Angeles,\" the 32-year-old wrote. An accompanying video showed Bale wearing an LAFC shirt and cap. \n \n Earlier the Los Angeles Times said Bale will be eligible to play for LAFC from July 1.  \n \n ESPN reported that Bale will fly to Los Angeles at the end of next week to sign a deal which runs to the end of this season, with an option for an additional year.  \n \n  Bale was once the world's most expensive player and has spent the last eight seasons with Real Madrid, winning three domestic championships and five Champions League titles. \n \n  The Welshman has scored 139 league goals in his club career with 39 goals in 106 internationals for Wales. \n \n  Bale played a pivotal role in helping Wales qualify for this year's World Cup, where they will face the United States, England and Iran in the group stage in Qatar. \n \n  It marks the first time Wales have qualified for the tournament since the 1958 finals. \n \n Bale's signing comes as LAFC bid to build on a strong start to the MLS season.  \n \n  The California club lead the Western Conference standings with 30 points from 15 games. \n \n  Bale will be the second high-profile international signing the club has made in recent weeks. Former Juventus and Italy international Giorgio Chiellini joined the club earlier this month. \n \n  News of Bale's decision to head to Major League Soccer comes just days after reports in Britain indicated he was in talks with Cardiff over a possible move. \n \n His former club Tottenham and Newcastle were also mooted as possible destinations.  \n \n",

            "title": "The Flu Vaccine May Help Keep Alzheimer's at Bay",
            "description": "A study found that adults over 65 vaccinated for the flu were noticeably less likely to develop Alzheimer's over a four year span than those unvaccinated. ",
            "content": "New research suggests even more benefits for flu vaccination in older people. The study found that adults over 65 who received at least one flu shot were noticeably less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease up to four years later. More research will be needed to confirm a cause-and-effect link and to figure out where this protective effect is coming from, however. \n \nAlzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, and is thought to currently affect more than 5 million Americans. There are lifestyle habits that may reduce a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s, such as regular exercise, and there are medications that can help manage its symptoms. But there are no treatments known to substantially prevent or reverse its progression. However, some research has pointed to a relationship between certain infections and Alzheimer’s, which has led to hopes that preventing or treating these infections may lower its incidence or delay its onset. \n \n In 2020, researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston analyzed medical records and found a link between flu vaccination and a lower associated risk of diagnosed Alzheimer’s. This time, they turned to an even larger database of medical claims and were able to compare the outcomes of nearly a million pairs of adults over 65 throughout the U.S. who were either vaccinated or unvaccinated for the flu. The pairs were matched in factors like age and were tracked for an average of 46 months. \n \n During the study period, 8.5% of unvaccinated adults were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or received medication often used to manage it, compared to 5.1% of vaccinated individuals—about a 40% lower relative risk. There also appeared to be a cumulative effect, such that people who consistently got vaccinated annually during the study period were the least likely to develop Alzheimer’s. The findings were published online this month in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. \n \n Studies in recent years have suggested that certain germs can hide in the brain following infection earlier on in life and directly trigger the development of Alzheimer’s, particularly herpesviruses. But the authors speculate that the connection seen in this study isn’t necessarily unique to influenza. Rather, it’s more about the relationship between our immune system and the aging brain. \n \n “Since there is evidence that several vaccines may protect from Alzheimer’s disease, we are thinking that it isn’t a specific effect of the flu vaccine,” said study author Paul Schulz, director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center at UT’s McGovern Medical School, in a statement. “Instead, we believe that the immune system is complex, and some alterations, such as pneumonia, may activate it in a way that makes Alzheimer’s disease worse. But other things that activate the immune system may do so in a different way—one that protects from Alzheimer’s disease.” \n \n These kinds of observational studies can only demonstrate a correlation between two things, not clearly prove a cause-and-effect link between vaccination and Alzheimer’s risk. But other research teams have found a similar connection. And of course, vaccines for the flu and other diseases remain effective at preventing severe illness from the germs they target—benefits that tend to be even more pronounced for older people. \n \n It will take time to figure out exactly why vaccines may help keep our brain in good shape, but they’re doing plenty of good for us already. The researchers, for their part, may next plan to study whether covid-19 vaccines can offer a similar buffering effect against dementia. ",

            "content": "The UK PM said the move would \"strike at the heart of Putin's war machine\". \n \n Gold exports were worth £12.6bn ($15.4bn) to Russia in 2021, and the UK says their importance has increased since the invasion as oligarchs rush to buy bullion to avoid sanctions.  \n \n  It comes as the G7 group of the world's richest nations meet in Germany. \n \n US President Biden suggested the other G7 nations - Germany, France and Italy - would also join the ban. \n \n \"Together, the G7 will announce that we will ban the import of Russian gold, a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Russia,\" he said in a tweet. \n \n UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: \"We need to starve the Putin regime of its funding. The UK and our allies are doing just that.\"  \n \n With London a major global trading hub for gold, the UK government said the move would have a huge impact on President Putin's ability to raise funds. \n \n Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Western countries have introduced a range of sanctions targeting wealthy individuals, banks, businesses and state-owned enterprises.  \n \n The US, European Union, UK and other countries have sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and businesses so far.  \n \n The latest measure will mean UK import restrictions will apply to Russian exports worth around £13.5bn.  \n \n  The UK said the gold import ban would come into force shortly, with legislation introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks. \n \n  It will apply to newly mined or refined gold, and does not impact gold previously exported from Russia. \n \n There are no plans to extend restrictions to Russian gold purchased legitimately before the import ban was put in place.  \n \n Discussions at the G7 summit in Bavaria are expected to focus on the international response to the war in Ukraine, as well as soaring prices and the global food crisis.  \n \n",

            "content": "Ben Affleck 's 10-year-old son was behind the wheel of a Lamborghini when it bumped into another vehicle over the weekend.  \n \n  Samuel, 10, had joined dad Ben, 49, and his fiancee Jennifer Lopez, 52, for a trip to luxury vehicle dealership 777 Exotics when the incident happened on Sunday. \n \n Ben had allowed his son into the driver's seat of a yellow Lamborghini that had the engine running as he browsed the motors on offer at the Los Angeles dealership.  \n \n While in the motor Samuel put the car in reverse, which resulted in the vehicle making contact with the front of a white BMW situated behind the Lamborghini.  \n \n  In video footage of the incident obtained by TMZ, it appears that the luxury sports car touched the BMW's front wheel and possibly the fender. \n \n  After reversing into the car, Samuel - who Ben shares with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner - then got out of the Lambo the look at where the car had bumped another vehicle. \n \n  Speaking with the American publication, a representative for Ben stated that no damage was caused and all involved were okay. \n \n Ben and Jennifer - who got engaged for a second time earlier this year - were later pictured comforting Samuel, with the Jenny From the Block singer snapped holding hands with her beau's son as they left the car dealership on Sunday  \n \n  Samuel is one of three children Ben shares with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, 50, whom he divorced in 2018. \n \n \"Our marriage didn't work, and that's difficult. Both of us really believe that it's important for kids to see their parents respect one another and get along, whether they're together or not,\" Ben explained to PEOPLE when discussing co-parenting with his ex-wife earlier this year.  \n \n The former couple are also parents to daughters Violet, 16, and Seraphina, 13, while Ben's wife-to-be Jennifer shares twins Emme and Max with ex-husband Marc Anthony. \n \n  Jennifer and Ben rekindled their romance last year, almost 20 years on from their original engagement and high-profile split. \n \n  In April, the mum-of-two explained exactly how her beau popped the question for the second time earlier this year and revealed all about the \"nothing fancy at all\" proposal.  \n \n  \"Saturday night while at my favorite place on earth (in the bubble bath), my beautiful love got on one knee and proposed,\" the Hustlers actress gushed in an On The JLo email update. \n \n  \"I was taken totally off guard and just looked in his eyes smiling and crying at the same time trying hard to get my head around the fact that after 20 years this was happening all over again, I was quite literally speechless and he said, “is that a yes?’” I said YES of course that's a YES.\" \n \n She continued to admit after the actor's proposal she was left crying with joy and feeling \" so incredibly happy and whole\".  \n \n  \"It was nothing fancy at all, but it was the most romantic thing I could've ever imagined...just a quiet Saturday night at home, two people promising to always be there for each other,\" she added when recalling the romantic moment. \n \n  The Love Don't Cost a Thing singer concluded by declared herself and the dad-of-three to be \"two very lucky people\" who have been given a second chance at true love. \n \n  The happy couple first met back in 2002 on the set of their critically-panned film, Gigli. At the time, Jennifer was still married to her second husband, Cris Judd. \n \n The singer went on to file for divorce from Cris in July 2002 and embarked on a very public relationship with Ben, which eventually led to the actor proposing to the star just months later in November 2002.  \n \n",

Given that it's one of the most expensive video games ever made, many felt let down by the product that was launched at the end of 2020. Luckily, things are much better now, though there's still room for improvement, and a new fan-made mod has just been released which makes the open world sci-fi game compatible with AMD's newest upscaling software. \n \n As spotted by DSO Gaming, modder PotatoOfDoom has created a mod for Cyberpunk 2077 that attempts to replace Nvidia's DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, with AMD's FSR, or FidelityFX Super Resolution. Specifically, it features version 2.0, which is the latest iteration of the tech from team red. The description on Nexus Mods says that this is still a \"proof of concept,\" but the developer has said that the results are \"quite impressive.\" Anyone who wishes to download and try the add-on are warned that it's still in development, so there may be some bugs.  \n \n  AMD released FSR 2.0 last month, with Arkane Studio's Deathloop being one of the first games to receive it. It offers a more open-source alternative to Nvidia's DLSS, which was one of the first upscaling technologies to hit the market, with the first iteration releasing in September 2020. While team green's software is becoming more open-source these days, it's mainly associated with the company's own RTX-based graphics cards, which is arguably what makes AMD's FSR somewhat more appealing. \n \n For those who aren't aware, image upscaling is pretty much an industry standard in gaming these days, up there with the likes of ray tracing. It essentially works by upscaling game visuals on the fly, redrawing pixels to make them comparable to higher resolutions. The idea behind it is to generate better graphics in games, without putting more strain on the hardware. Even Apple has announced its own upscaling tech, called MetalFX.  \n \n As for the game itself, CD Projekt Red is currently working on official DLC for Cyberpunk 2077. While the wounds may still be a little fresh for some, many people are prepared to move on from the blunder that was the game's 2020 launch. With a huge patch going live in February, many severe issues were finally fixed. But for some, the damage has already been done and it could take a while for CDPR's reputation to be fully restored.  \n \n",

            "title": "Trump's Temper Becomes Focus of Explosive Jan. 6 Committee Testimony",
            "description": " ‘I'm the f– president. Take me up to the Capitol now,’ Trump was said to have told his security detail before lunging at a steering wheel as he sought to join rioters on Jan. 6.",
            "content": "\"A very stable genius.\" \n \n That's how then-President Donald Trump described himself at a press conference in 2018, amid criticism that his bombastic tweets were less than presidential. \n \n And that was not the personality described Tuesday by Cassidy Hutchinson, a senior aide to Trump's chief of staff, as she testified about Trump's behavior as the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol unfolded. \n \n Inside \"The Beast\" – the nickname of the presidential limo – Trump demanded to be taken to the Capitol but was told by his Secret Service detail it was not a safe environment. \n \n An enraged Trump yelled, \"I'm the f– president. Take me up to the Capitol now,\" Hutchinson, who worked for Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, told the committee, recounting details relayed to her by high-level White House staff. When the driver did not comply, the then-president reached over to grab the steering wheel. \n \n \"Sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel,\" an agent told the president. \"We're going back to the West Wing. We're not going to the Capitol.\" Undeterred, Trump lunged at the throat of a member of his security detail. The president ended up not going to the Hill, where, Hutchinson testified, he had hoped to go, taking charge as a self-determined, reelected president, even though he had just lost to Democrat Joe Biden by several million votes. \n \n Many Americans have endured a mercurial boss. And new presidents often have trouble adjusting to the bizarre contradiction of being the most powerful person in the world, only to have your daily movements controlled by others who ostensibly work for you. Bill Clinton, for example, famously went for a jog on the street – forcing Secret Service agents to hastily accompany him, running in their suits – and once wanted to take the train to a presidential event (he was talked out of it after security explained they can't turn a train around if there's a threat). \n \n And many presidents have had easily triggered tempers. Richard Nixon famously had an \"enemies list,\" while Lyndon B. Johnson referred to his foes as \"pissants\" and reportedly ordered an aide off of Air Force One (it was flying over an ocean at the time). \n \n Trump displayed early signs of a bad temper, often provoked by a sense that others were disloyal. Some psychiatric experts under the banner Duty to Warn, based on publicly available information and without having examined the president, nevertheless cautioned that Trump appeared to have a condition called malignant narcissism – which is incurable and rooted in delusions of superiority and anger that others do not recognize their greatness. \n \n And as he sought to cling to power denied him by a democratic election, Trump, Hutchinson revealed in testimony before the House committee, was highly volatile and angry when challenged or thwarted in his mission. \n \n When Trump learned that his attorney general, William Barr, had given an interview to the Associated Press, affirming there was no widespread voter fraud as Trump had claimed, the president threw his lunch at the wall, Hutchinson testified, smearing the paint with his favorite condiment. \n \n \"So I grabbed a towel and started wiping the ketchup off the wall to help the valet out,\" Hutchinson said. That jibes with the account in the book \"Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show,\" in which author Jonathan Karl reports that Trump \"had the look and manner of a madman\" when he learned of Barr's remarks. \n \n And that wasn't the only time, Hutchinson said. Trump also was known to pull the tablecloth off a table, bringing food and dishes down with it. \n \n \"Irate,\" was how Hutchinson said Robert Engel (the agent who was the target of Trump's lunge in “The Beast”) described the president. \n \n The president was also visibly angry at the crowd assembling at the Ellipse that day, saying it was not the packed capacity he desired. The president knew that some of the people gathered in Washington that day had weapons, including AR-15s, and would not be able to get past the magnetometers the Secret Service used to make sure no one was bringing weapons near the president. \n \n \"He was angry about the extra space and wanted more people to come in,\" Hutchinson said. \n \n Trump, Hutchinson said, reporting conversations with other White House personnel, said, \"I don't f– care that they have weapons. They're not here to hurt me. Take the f– mags away. Let my people in. They can march to the Capitol from here. Let the people in. Take the f– mags away.\" \n \n Instead, the armed insurrectionists went directly to the Capitol, where some rioters called for Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, to be hanged. \n \n That, too, led to a conversation between Meadows and White House lawyer Pat Cipollone, Hutchinson recalled. \n \n \"I remember Pat Cipollone saying, 'They're literally calling for the VP to be f– hung,'\" she said. Meadows turned to Cipollone. \n \n \"You heard him, Pat. He thinks Mike deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong.\" \n \nCipollone, Hutchinson said, had a blunt response. \n \n \"This is f- crazy,\" Trump's lawyer said. ",

            "description": "A study found that adults over 65 vaccinated for the flu were noticeably less likely to develop Alzheimer's over a four year span than those unvaccinated. ",
            "content": " The U.S. will soon greatly expand its vaccination program for monkeypox. On Tuesday evening, the Biden administration announced that it is planning to release a stockpile of over a million vaccine doses to the public by the end of fall. The vaccines will primarily be given to close contacts of confirmed cases and others with a higher risk of exposure, such as gay and bisexual men who have had multiple recent sex partners in areas where the emerging disease has been spotted. \n \n The updated strategy announced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Tuesday will call for a gradual rollout of the country’s supply of the JYNNEOS vaccine. Nearly 300,000 doses will be distributed nationwide in the coming weeks, including 56,000 doses immediately. Another 750,000 doses will be made available during the summer. And up to 500,000 doses should be released later in the year, assuming that they pass the inspection process. All in all, around 1.6 million doses of the two-dose vaccine are expected to be available through the stockpile this year. \n \n The vaccines became available so quickly because the monkeypox virus is closely related to the now-extinct smallpox virus, which was eradicated through a massive global vaccination campaign in 1980. Countries have still maintained a stockpile of smallpox vaccines to this day, however, in part because there’s always the small possibility that the virus could be resurrected as a bioweapon agent. And these vaccines are also thought to be effective against closely related viruses like monkeypox. Indeed, smallpox vaccines do not contain the virus itself, but another related virus called vaccinia. \n \n The U.S. does have a much larger stockpile of the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine available as well, and the HHS has said that it will release doses to jurisdictions that request it. But the ACAM2000 vaccine comes with more significant side effects than JYNNEOS, making it less suitable for mass distribution, the agency said. In 2019, JYNNEOS became the first vaccine in the U.S. to be approved for both smallpox and monkeypox. It’s estimated to be 85% effective against monkeypox, but that estimate is based on limited real world data. The vaccine can also be given to people soon after a suspected exposure, which should reduce the risk of illness. \n \n In announcing the expanded rollout of its stockpile, the U.S. is following in the footsteps of other countries like the UK. Like these countries, the U.S. will be allocating doses on a priority basis, depending on people’s risk of exposure. At the top will be people known to be in close, prolonged contact with confirmed or suspected cases, followed by those whose sexual partners have been diagnosed with monkeypox, and finally “men who have sex with men who have recently had multiple sex partners in a venue where there was known to be monkeypox or in an area where monkeypox is spreading.” Within these tiers, considerations like a person’s existing health will be taken into account as well. \n \n“Our goal right now is to ensure that the limited supply of JYNNEOS vaccine is deployed to those who can benefit from it most immediately, as we continue to secure additional vaccine doses,” said HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O’Connell, in a statement. \n \n Monkeypox is thought to primarily infect rodents. Until recently, it had only occasionally spread from animals to humans following its discovery in the 1950s. But there have been more than 4,000 confirmed or suspected cases reported globally in humans this year, including over 300 in the U.S., which is a caseload far above the sporadic outbreaks previously seen in some parts of Africa. Though it may have been circulating in humans at low levels for several years now, its current spread appears to be fueled by close contact during sex. So far, outbreaks have primarily involved men who sleep with men, but the virus can spread to anyone through close contact with someone’s infected rashes and possibly respiratory particles \n \n  Last weekend, the World Health Organization declined to declare a public health emergency of international concern over monkeypox for the time being, though they continued to stress that greater international cooperation and action will be needed to contain the virus before it can permanently become endemic in more parts of the world.

            "content": "Two love stories, two missing teens: What really happened on vacation 15 years ago? \n \n Peacock series “The Resort” follows present-day couple Noah (William Jackson Harper) and Emma (Cristin Milioti), who travel to a luxury Yucatan resort to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. Yet Emma soon becomes fascinated with two missing former hotel guests, played by “Righteous Gemstones” and “Booksmart” breakout Skyler Gisondo and newcomer Nina Bloomgarden, who disappeared 15 years prior. A missing persons case, a dead body, and a hurricane all make up the mystery of what really happened all those years ago and Emma and Noah are intent on solving the mystery of the Oceana Vista Resort. “The Resort” premieres July 29 with the first three episodes available to stream, with new episodes released weekly. \n \n    Nick Offerman, Luis Gerardo Méndez, Gabriela Cartol, Ben Sinclair, Parvesh Cheena, Debby Ryan, Michael Hitchcock, Becky Ann Baker, and Dylan Baker also star. \n \n “Palm Springs” screenwriter Andy Siara serves as showrunner, executive producer, and writer, alongside co-showrunner Allison Miller (“Angelyne”). “Mr. Robert” creator Sam Esmail and Chad Hamilton of Esmail Corp via Anonymous Content also executive produce, with Sarah Matte as co-executive producer. \n \n Co-showrunner Siara described “The Resort” as “the beginning of one love story, framed by the beginning of the end of another” in Entertainment Weekly, citing the “disappointment of time” as the main existential obstacle in the mystery. \n \n     “If you’re into dissecting clues along the way, there are enough of them layered throughout — a throwaway line, a prop, a photo, an item of clothing, a music cue, a smell — for you to start piecing together the larger puzzle,” Siara explained. “At the same time, if you typically only have one 30-minute TV show in you before you pass out at the end of a long, emotionally draining day at work, and, therefore, you prefer shows where you can just turn off your brain and go for a fun ride while nursing your beer, or wine, or popcorn, or bowl of ice cream — this show is for you, too.” \n \n  Siara’s “Palm Springs,” directed by Max Barbakow, broke records at 2020 Sundance and similarly dealt with the construct of time in a “Groundhog Day”-esque premise starring Milioti as a victim of timeless repetition. “Palm Springs” went on to become one of Hulu’s biggest hits of all time, with lead star Milioti telling IndieWire that the Siara’s script is “an existential comedy, and it’s about the discomfort of having to sit in your own stuff.” \n \n Seems like Milioti has packed her suitcase once again to play a character ready to confront her own baggage in a picturesque locale.

Had to call in the GOAT to bring back another GOAT,” while sharing the audio of a three-way call between Diaz, himself, and quarterback Tom Brady, who is also entering Hollywood post-retirement. \n \n “@CameronDiaz and I are BACK IN ACTION – our new movie with @NetflixFilm,” Foxx added. “Production starting later this year!!” \n \n The audio snippet reveals Diaz telling Fox she is “so anxious” about coming back to acting. “I’m like pacing the room,” Diaz says. “I feel excited, but I don’t know how to do this, you know?” \n \n Foxx responds, “I understand. Listen, I got somebody on the other line that can help you with this.” \n \n “I was talking to Jamie and he said you need a few tips on how to un-retire,” the star of the upcoming “Eighty for Brady” said. “I’m relatively successful at un-retiring.” \n \n Netflix retweeted Foxx’s post, captioning, “Cameron Diaz is officially un-retiring!! She will star with Jamie Foxx in a new Netflix movie — and we have an unexpected person to thank for getting her back in action…” \n \n Foxx and Diaz previously collaborated on “Any Given Sunday” and 2014’s “Annie,” which marked Diaz’s last role before announcing her retirement. \n \n “Back in Action” will be directed by Seth Gordon from a script he co-wrote with Brendan O’Brien (“Neighbors”). Foxx is executive producing the film with Datari Turner, O’Brien, and Mark McNair. Producers are Beau Bauman (“Central Intelligence”) for Good One Productions and Gordon via Exhibit A, as Variety reported. \n \nDiaz spoke out about her career in Hollywood earlier this year, telling “RuPaul’s Drag Race” judge Michelle Visage on podcast “Rule Breakers” that she had to reflect on the “trap of it all.” \n \n “I am absolutely a victim to all of the societal objectifications and exploitations that women are subjected to. I have bought into all of them myself at certain times,” Diaz said. “Fame is very infantilizing. It’s very much about keeping somebody coddled in a state of like, we see a little child and think, ‘It’s so cute, I want it to always be cute, and if I keep it cute by always treating it cute, maybe it’ll stay cute forever.’ And that’s how people treat you.” \n \n The “Charlie’s Angels” icon previously told Kevin Hart on his Peacock talk show “Hart to Heart” that stepping away from being a “machine” in Hollywood was for the sake of her “personal, spiritual self.” \n \n “When you do something at a really high level for a long period of time, when you’re the person that’s sort of delivering on this one thing, everything around, all parts of you that isn’t that, has to sort of be handed off to other people,” Diaz said, via NME. “It’s fun to do, I love it, I love acting, I could go forever, I sometimes feel like I have unlimited energy and inertia. I just looked around and there were so many parts of my life that I wasn’t touching and that I wasn’t managing, and I couldn’t really manage, because everything was so massive.” ",

            "description": " Republicans - and Democrats - view the nation's trajectory poorly, while the number of those who say they feel 'extreme' pride in the country falls to record low.",
            "content": "The nation has appeared starkly divided in recent weeks, with major Supreme Court rulings exposing chasms on guns and abortion amid pitched political battles over immigration, LGBTQ rights and the handling of the economy. But Americans are in agreement on at least one thing: the country is heading in the wrong direction. \n \n The vast majority of Americans are pessimistic about the state of the country, according to an AP-NORC poll released Wednesday. And while a majority of Republicans have believed so since President Joe Biden was elected, a growing number of Democrats (78%), who had remained positive, now say the same. \n \n The survey, conducted June 23-27, says that American’s view of the nation’s trajectory is reflected in Biden’s low approval rating, where he performs highly for his handling of the pandemic but is viewed poorly for the economy and gun policy. \n \nThe economy, in particular, mirrors Americans’ view of the nation’s trajectory, with 79% of adults considering the economy to be in poor condition, driven by an increasingly negative outlook among Democrats. \n \n The number of people who say they are extremely proud to be American has likewise taken a tumble, falling to a new low of 38%, according to Gallup polling. \n \n The results come during what Gallup called a “challenging time in the U.S.,” citing a pandemic-weary public and the highest U.S. inflation rate in more than four decades and a string of mass shootings from Buffalo, New York, to Uvalde, Texas. But it also notes that the poll was conducted even before the Supreme Court’s major rulings on guns and abortion – both of which, Gallup notes, moved opposite public opinion. \n \n “Extreme” national pride has been on the decline since 2015 falling nearly 20 points lower than where it stood a decade ago and marking the lowest scores on record for both independents and Republicans. But Republicans, with 58% citing extreme pride in the nation, consistently outpace Democrats (26%) and independents (34%) on the measure. \n \n  Gallup notes that patriotism depends on a variety of factors, including the popularity of the president, the economy, health and high-profile events, but added that in recent years, all parties have become less likely to say they’re proud of the country, which may be a reflection of “deepening political divisions and party gridlock in Washington, as well as national challenges regarding race relations, COVID-19 policies and inflation.

            "description": "A follow-up mission by the European Space Agency could find a very different looking Dimorphos.",
            "content": "In order to protect the Earth, some sacrificesmust be made. NASA’s DART spacecraft is currently on its way to a binary asteroid system known as Didymos and will essentially crash into one tiny asteroid to test out a deflection method. But rather than leaving behind an impact crater as initially intended, the DART spacecraft may actually deform the mini-moon, making it nearly unrecognizable. \n \n Using a new model, a group of researchers have simulated the entire cratering process and discovered that the asteroid deflection mission might completely alter its target, changing its appearance far more severely than previously believed.  \n \n “The DART impact could globally deform Dimorphos, and therefore change its overall shape significantly, instead of creating just a small crater,” Martin Jutzi, co-author of the study, which was published in The Planetary Science Journal, told Gizmodo in an email. \n \n As seen in the above illustration, the mini-moon, dubbed Dimorphos (formerly known as Didymoon), could take on one of these six possible shapes following the spacecraft’s impact. The whole cratering process could take a few hours, which is why previous models of the impact did not predict the asteroid’s subsequent deformation. “Previous models were only able to simulate the first seconds of such events,” Jutzi said. \n \n Short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, the DART mission launched in November 2021 towards the Didymos asteroid system. Didymos is an 800-meter wide rock with its own 170-meter wide moon known as Dimorphos, the main target of DART. The spacecraft will smash into the mini-moon at 15,000 miles per hour (24, 140 kilometers per hour), attempting to offset its orbit. The impact is scheduled for late September or early October, when the pair will come within 7 million miles (11 million kilometers) of Earth. \n \n The purpose of the test is to experiment with kinetic impactor technology as a means of deflecting asteroids that could be headed towards Earth. NASA and other space agencies, keep a close watch on asteroids that come too close for comfort in order to assess whether or not they pose a threat to our planet. But as far as defending Earth from incoming asteroid impacts, there’s no clear cut plan on what to do. \n \n “These weak asteroids could actually be deflected much more strongly and larger amounts of material could be ejected from the impact than the previous estimates predicted,” Jutzi said. “These larger effects should be easier to observe immediately after the DART impact.” So the DART mission will still be able to perform the experiment, just perhaps with a different outcome than initially anticipated. \n \n The European Space Agency (ESA) is also planning a follow-up mission to the pair of space rocks. ESA is scheduled to launch its Hera mission in 2024, which will rendezvous with Didymos by 2026 to study the impact crater left behind by DART, and any other changes made to the asteroid. If Dimorphos has indeed taken on a different appearance, it may provide valuable data on the asteroid itself. \n \n“Ideally, this will allow us to learn something about the asteroid’s interior, rather than just the surface,” Jutzi said. “This would in turn provide very valuable information about the asteroid’s bulk properties and improve our understanding of asteroids in general.”  ",

Hamilton said the \"time has come for action\" following Piquet's remarks, while Formula One and motorsport's governing body the FIA condemned the 69-year-old Brazilian. \"I apologise wholeheartedly to anyone that was affected, including Lewis, who is an incredible driver, but the translation in some media that is now circulating on social media is not correct,\" Piquet said in a statement. \n \n Piquet, who won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987, was discussing an accident between Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen on the first lap of last year's British Grand Prix when he used the term. \n \n  His daughter, Kelly, is Verstappen's partner.\n \n \"What I said was ill thought out, and I make no defence for it, but I will clarify that the term used is one that has widely and historically been used colloquially in Brazilian Portuguese as a synonym for 'guy' or 'person' and was never intended to offend,\" said Piquet. \n \n  \"I would never use the word I have been accused of in some translations. I strongly condemn any suggestion that the word was used by me with the aim of belittling a driver because of his skin colour.\" Piquet is a supporter of Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and was a chauffeur to him on the country's Independence Day last year. \n \n Hamilton, the only black driver on the grid, has been an outspoken campaigner for greater diversity in the sport. \n \n The seven-time world champion regularly displayed \"Black Lives Matter\" on his apparel and took the knee before races in the 2020 season following the murder of George Floyd in the US.

            "content": " Hochul is set to propose a slew of ideas in response to last week's Supreme Court decision to strike down a state law that had limited the concealed carry of handguns in public to people who had \"proper cause.\" \"There's more to do, this is a nationwide crisis. Too many lives are being lost here in New York, but I will not rest, as the governor of this state, until we have done everything in our power to end this gun epidemic once and for all,\" Hochul said. \n \n The legislation will define a number of \"sensitive locations\" where people will not be allowed to carry concealed guns, Hochul said. \n \n Those locations include: federal, state, local government buildings; health and medical facilities; places where children gather like daycares, parks, zoos and playgrounds; public transportation like subways and buses; polling places; and educational institutions, Hochul said. \n \nIf the proposed bill is signed into law, all private businesses will be classified as \"no open carry\" areas by default, unless business owners post signage indicating that people are allowed to carry concealed weapons, Hochul said. \n \n Hochul's proposed legislation will also strengthen the list of disqualifying criteria, banning those with a history of dangerous behavior from being able to get a permit. \n \n The laws will also add a vehicle requirement to existing safe storage laws, requiring gun owners to lock up their guns when they are traveling to cut down on gun thefts from cars. \n \n Gun owners with children in their homes aged 18 or younger will have to get safe storage for their guns, keeping them locked up. \n \n The laws will improve information sharing for state police background checks, Hochul said. \n \n Gun owners will also be required to get over 15 hours of in-person training to receive a concealed carry permit, Hochul said. \n \nHochul said the laws will require a background check for all purchases of ammunition for guns that need a permit. Gun owners will have to show their permit at the time of purchase. \n \n The special legislative session comes over a month after a gunman killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in an allegedly racially motivated attack.

            "content": " Chinese AAA studio, Lightspeed Studios, announced that it is adapting a famous wuxia novel series into a martial arts game called Code: To Jin Yong. The demo trailer displays stylish combat that incorporates aggrandized aerial movements and combat, which are fairly common in wuxia cinema. While most action games tether players to the ground, Code: To Jin Yong lets them jump grand distances and fly around the screen at high speeds. \n \n Developed by Epic Games, Unreal Engine 5 is the most recent iteration in the 3D computer graphics game engine that many different games studios implement to create their games. Code: To Jin Yong is being made using Unreal Engine 5, which allows the developers to depict outrageous martial arts motions through the engine’s advanced physics system. Gorgeous visuals surround the fight at the center of the trailer and show off the engine's ability to render high-quality environments and keep them running at high graphical fidelity during high-action sequences. \n \n The trailer does not have a voiceover or any explanation at all and lets the gameplay speak for itself as the characters go after each other in a high-speed, intense fight. The physics engine and improved graphics of Unreal Engine 5 shine through in the trailer as the visual details surrounding the fast-paced battle sequence hold fast during the smooth fight. Camera angles and features are important in a game, and the dynamic camera angles in Code: To Jin Yong make the fight look extremely cinematic. \n \n The Chinese game development industry is in motion as agencies start to approve and regulate more projects for domestic releases, such as Wuchang: Fallen Feathers and Black Myth: Wukong. Lightspeed Studios has only released AAA games for mobile so far, and the trailer for Code: To Jin Yong acknowledges that the trailer “does not reflect the quality of the final product.” Publisher Tencent has not announced a release date, so it may be quite a while before players are able to play Code: To Jin Yong. \n \n  Kung fu games and other titles steeped in Chinese culture are popular all over the world, and Code: To Jin Yong should be no different if the final release looks anything like the trailer.

            "content": "The UK's largest airport asked airlines to cut the flights because it was expecting more passenger numbers than it can currently cope with. \n \n Some passengers did not know that their flights were cancelled until they arrived at the airport. \n \n Heathrow said the cancellations were necessary for safety. \n \n Travel writer and broadcaster Andy Mossack tweeted that there was \"total chaos\" and \"zero customer service\" at the airport on Thursday morning. \n \n A Heathrow spokesman said: \"We will work with airlines to get affected passengers rebooked onto other flights outside of the peak so that as many as possible can get away, and we apologise for the impact this has on travel plans. \n \n \"We are working hard to ensure everyone has a smooth journey through Heathrow this summer, and the most important thing is to make sure that all service providers at the airport have enough resources to meet demand.\" \n \n A spokesman from British Airways, one of the airlines affected, said: \"As a result of Heathrow's requirement for all airlines to reduce their schedules, we've made a small number of cancellations.\" \n \n The airline said it was in contact with affected customers to \"apologise, advise them of their consumer rights and offer them alternative options, including a refund or rebooking.\" ",
